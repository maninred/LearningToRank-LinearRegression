# LearningToRank-LinearRegression
In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. In our project, the linear regression model is being implemented using closed form solution and we are trying to optimize the values by tuning the hyper parameters.
